/* CSS precedence order from strongest to weakest: */
/* 1. Styles marked with the !important keyword take priority over all else. */
/* 2. Inline styles made using the style attribute take priority over all except for styles marked with !important keywords. */
/* 3. Targeting an element through an ID attribute "#" takes next priority. */
/* 4. Next in priority comes targeting an element through one of an elements class attributes ".". */
/* 5. Then comes tag selectors */
/* 6. Styles of the same precedence applied later take effect over styles applied earlier. */
/* Remember only apply styles to an element and not a class if you won't those styles to apply to all the elements accross the whole site as all pages will be connected to the same stylesheets!*/

/* Foundational small styles that set up all base styles for the whole website and designed first most for mobile devices. */
